*In this mindset, the hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts.Although people may differ in every which way — in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments — everyone can change and grow through application and exercise*

 **replay iam reminding my self as positive word like :**
  **you can be good at any thing,you like learning about thing you don't know, and try untilyou get result you want**
